        <h2> What I have learned</h2>
       <p >Firstly, I've learned how to develop websites using fundamental languages such as JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
            I learned how to be responsive but not yet perfect. I learned how to decorate my website such as putting a background image, hover and so much more. I learned how to deploy files from visual studio code to github. <br> I also learned how to git clone repository from github.</P>
