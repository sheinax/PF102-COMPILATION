        <h2> What I have learned</h2>
        <p >Firstly, I've learned how to develop websites using fundamental languages such as JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. 
            I learned how software can adjust and interact, which opens up new possibilities. I learned how to adjust those sizes that I want to change. I learned how to decorate my website such as putting a background image, hover and so much more. I learned how to call the links and I learned how to deploy files from visual studio code to github. I also learned how to git clone repository from github.</P>
